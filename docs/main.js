The gods of life promote vitality and                     health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away                     the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this                     domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods                     (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as IlIllatcr,                     Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).";case c.Light:return"Gods of light-including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakty-                    promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, adn beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some                     of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others                     are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through ever deception. Some are deities of beauty and                     artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls                     infused with radiance and the power of their god's discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning                     away darkness.";case c.Nature:return"Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world                     itself, from illscrutable gods of the deep forests (such                     as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly                     deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath).                     Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities,                     practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in                     their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well,                     champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a                     particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities                     that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or                     wither the crops of those who anger their gods.";case c.Tempest:return"Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain- including                     Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor-govern                     storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods                     of earthquakes, some tire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical                     strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over                     other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts.                     In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean                     deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to                     inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of                     righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to                     ward off divine wrath.";case c.Trickery:return"Gods of trickery-such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler,                     Garl Glittergold, and Loki-are mischief-makers and instigators who stand                     as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortais.                     They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators.                     Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride,                     mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and                     flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception,                     and theft rather than direct confrontation.";case c.War:return"War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people.                     It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice                     eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case,                     the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great                     deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others                     to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.                     Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as                     Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of                     destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury,                     Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination                     (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods                     (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war                    in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below)/\nStructures.

If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble.

Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form.

For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack/\n• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll/\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.
